## Project: Identify Customer Segments

### Goal 

The goal of this project is to work with real-life data provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. 
The data concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. 
Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products 
for a mailout campaign. Using unsupervised learning techniques, organize the general population into clusters, then use 
those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
