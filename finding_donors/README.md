## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

### Goal 
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization interested in expanding their potential donor base. CharityML would like to send letters to residents of California who are most likely to donate to the charity. The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
